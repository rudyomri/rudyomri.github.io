This Green Dining Map is the product of an undergraduate group project for the UW Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies food sustainability capstone led by Holly Gibbs. Our hope is to educate our community about the variety of sustainable dining options that are available on campus. There is currently a gap in information about the location, knowledge of food sustainability, and specific benefits from campus eateries that can be accessed in one place. After looking at food guides from other campuses, and finding that the UW Madison campus does not have one, we found it imperative to investigate our campusâ€™ dining options and create something that can connect students to their food choices. Our team visited each eatery on campus and gathered information about the sustainable food options at each location. We decided to implement our findings in a user-friendly, familiar map interface in order to make information about menu items and food sustainability more accessible to students. We hope this map helps the campus community make more sustainable food choices in the future! <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
